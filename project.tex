\end{center}

This project develops an AI-based electricity load and peak demand forecasting system for short-term (hourly to day-ahead) and medium-term horizons, integrating historical load, weather, and calendar features to improve grid operations and peak mitigation. The system compares baseline statistical models (ARIMA), machine learning methods (Random Forest, XGBoost), and deep learning architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Temporal Fusion Transformer), evaluating accuracy using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, MASE, and sMAPE. Recent literature shows deep models outperform classical baselines for non-linear, seasonally complex demand, with BiLSTM and hybrid CNN-LSTM achieving low MAPE on public datasets, and attention-based transformers excelling at multi-horizon forecasting with interpretability benefits [5][6][2]. The proposed pipeline includes robust preprocessing (missing-value handling, lag and rolling features, cyclical encodings), feature fusion with weather exogenous variables, and hyperparameter tuning. A deployable API (FastAPI) exposes forecasts and peak alerts, while the design allows extension to probabilistic forecasting for risk-aware operations [7][8]. On benchmark datasets (PJM/Kaggle; UCI household) and local utility-style samples, the best deep model reduced MAPE versus ARIMA/XGBoost baselines and improved peak-hour recall—key for unit commitment and demand response planning [9][10]. The project contributes an educational yet production-lean architecture and a comparative study aligned with current utility-grade practices and academic literature [11][12].

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\section{Overview}
Accurate electricity demand forecasting is vital for secure, economic grid operations, particularly as grids face rapid growth from AI data centers, EV adoption, and variable renewable integration. Forecasts guide unit commitment, dispatch, and demand response; even small accuracy gains can translate to substantial operational savings. AI methods—especially deep learning—have surpassed traditional statistical models in capturing non-linear, multi-scale seasonality and exogenous effects, enabling improved short-term and day-ahead predictions for both aggregate load and peak periods. This project designs and evaluates a practical forecasting system using LSTM-family networks and transformers against classical baselines, delivering an end-to-end, deployable solution for academic and utility-style contexts [24][19][2].


\section{Problem Formulation}
Given time-indexed historical load series y(t) with exogenous variables X(t) (weather, calendar, events), learn a mapping f such that ŷ(t+h)=f(y(t−w+1…t), X(t−w+1…t), X(t+1…t+h)) for horizons h∈{1…24} (hourly day-ahead) and select medium-term variants. Objectives include minimizing MAE/RMSE/MAPE and maximizing peak-hour detection recall under realistic constraints (data quality, latency, interpretability). Evaluate multiple models—ARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM/BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and transformer (TFT)—and assess both point and peak-centric metrics [2][21][20].

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Build a robust data pipeline: cleaning, imputation, lag/rolling/cyclical features, and weather fusion for hourly demand [12][2].

\item Benchmark classical (ARIMA), ML (Random Forest/XGBoost), and DL (LSTM/BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, TFT) models on open datasets and a local sample [11][8].

\item Optimize hyperparameters and compare multi-horizon performance using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, MASE, and sMAPE; add peak-hour precision/recall [25][26].

\item Deliver a deployable FastAPI endpoint and a minimal dashboard for real-time inference and alerts [22][19].

\item Document trade-offs (accuracy, complexity, data needs) and propose future extensions (probabilistic forecasts, federated learning, GNNs) [7][3][27].
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}
The motivation for this research stems from several critical factors in the evolving energy landscape:

\subsection{Grid Modernization and Complexity}
Modern power systems are experiencing unprecedented challenges due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increasing integration of variable renewable energy sources
\item Growing adoption of electric vehicles and electrified heating
\item Rising demands from data centers and AI applications
\item Implementation of demand response programs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Economic Impact}
Research indicates that improving forecast accuracy by just 1\% can result in operational cost savings of millions of dollars annually for large utilities. Accurate demand forecasting enables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal generation scheduling
\item Reduced spinning reserves
\item Minimized fuel costs
\item Efficient market participation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environmental Considerations}
Enhanced forecasting capabilities contribute to environmental sustainability through:
\begin{itemize}
\item Better integration of renewable energy sources
\item Reduced greenhouse gas emissions from backup generation
\item Optimized energy storage utilization
\item Improved demand-side management
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technological Advancement}
Recent breakthroughs in AI and deep learning present unprecedented opportunities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Deep learning models achieving MAPE values below 2\%
\item Advanced architectures like transformers and graph neural networks
\item Improved processing of high-dimensional time series data
\item Enhanced capability to capture complex non-linear relationships
\end{itemize}

This research aims to leverage these developments to create practical, implementable solutions for the electricity industry's forecasting challenges.


\chapter{BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW}

\section{Load Forecasting and Horizons}
Load forecasting predicts future electricity demand over short-term (minutes to days), medium-term (weeks to months), and long-term (months to years), supporting operations, maintenance planning, and capacity expansion respectively. Short-term forecasts are critical for unit commitment and balancing markets; day-ahead accuracy with calibrated peaks is particularly valuable for cost and reliability [13][19].

\section{Classical vs AI Methods}
Classical models (ARIMA/SARIMA) offer interpretability but struggle with non-linearities and exogenous drivers. Machine learning (Random Forest/XGBoost/SVR) leverages engineered features and handles non-linearity; deep learning (LSTM/BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, Transformers) learns temporal structure directly, often achieving lower MAPE and better peak capture when trained with sufficient data. Automated ML and decomposition-hybrid approaches (EEMD/VMD + LSTM) continue to push accuracy [21][5][17][23][6].

\section{Key Features and Data Sources}
Effective systems blend load history with weather (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation), calendar (hour-of-day, weekday/weekend, holidays), and special events. Public sources include UCI Household Electricity, PJM Kaggle datasets, and Monash repository; operational APIs (e.g., EIA) provide real-time feeds in certain geographies. Feature engineering includes lags (1, 24, 168), rolling stats, and cyclical encodings for temporal periodicity [16][9][10][28].

\section{Evaluation Metrics}
For point forecasts, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE quantify error behavior; MASE benchmarks against naive forecasts; sMAPE stabilizes percentage errors. For operations, peak-focused metrics (precision/recall during top-k demand hours) are crucial. Multi-horizon evaluation (e.g., h=1...24) reveals degradation with horizon length and guides architecture selection [25][29][26].

\section{Recent Literature Snapshot}
\begin{itemize}
\item BiLSTM residential forecasting with high accuracy on hourly data [5]
\item AutoML tree-based pipelines (GlorEST) showing strong baselines in structured settings [6]

\item Attention/Transformer architectures enabling interpretable multi-horizon forecasting (TFT) [8][14]
\item Surveys on deep learning for smart grid forecasting and demand-side perspectives [12][13]
