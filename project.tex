\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\section{Overview}
Electricity demand forecasting represents a critical function in modern power systems, enabling utilities to maintain the delicate balance between supply and demand while optimizing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This research investigates the application of artificial intelligence techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of electricity demand predictions, with particular emphasis on peak load forecasting.

The importance of accurate load forecasting has intensified dramatically in recent years, driven by multiple factors including the integration of renewable energy sources, increasing electrification of transportation and heating systems, and the growing demands of data centers and AI applications. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), compound annual growth rates for aggregate load are projected to nearly double from 0.6\% to 1.1\% over the next decade, underscoring the critical need for advanced forecasting capabilities.

    \label{fig:ai_ml_methods}
\end{figure}


\section{Problem Formulation}
The challenge of electricity demand forecasting encompasses multiple temporal horizons and complexities:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Short-term forecasting} (minutes to days) is essential for real-time grid operations, unit commitment, and economic dispatch decisions.
\item \textbf{Medium-term forecasting} (weeks to months) supports maintenance planning, fuel procurement, and seasonal resource allocation.
\item \textbf{Long-term forecasting} (months to years) guides infrastructure planning, capacity expansion, and investment decisions.
\end{itemize}

Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA models have shown limitations in capturing the non-linear relationships and complex patterns in electricity consumption data. This research addresses these limitations by exploring advanced AI-based approaches, particularly deep learning models that can automatically extract complex temporal patterns and dependencies from raw data.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Develop Advanced AI Models:} Design and implement state-of-the-art deep learning architectures including LSTM networks, CNN-LSTM hybrids, and transformer-based models for electricity demand forecasting, targeting prediction accuracies above 97\% with MAPE values below 2\%.

\item \textbf{Multi-horizon Forecasting:} Create an integrated forecasting system capable of providing accurate predictions across different time horizons:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Short-term (minutes to days) with MAPE < 2\% for real-time operations
    \item Medium-term (weeks to months) for maintenance planning
    \item Long-term (months to years) for infrastructure development
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Feature Engineering and Data Integration:} Develop comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines that incorporate:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Temporal features (hour, day, season patterns)
    \item Weather data integration
    \item Economic indicators

    \item Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Practical Implementation:} Design deployment strategies for real-world utility operations, including:
